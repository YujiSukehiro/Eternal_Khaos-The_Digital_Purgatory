# Khaos Development Roadmap - Sonnet Phase Plan

## Development Philosophy
Each phase builds incrementally on the previous one, with clear testable outcomes. We add one system at a time to identify issues early and maintain stability.

## üèîÔ∏è Big Goals (Overarching Milestones)

### 1. **Combat Feel Revolution**
Transform the combat from functional to visceral through the hand system. Players should feel the weight and impact of every swing through visible grip changes, hand tension, and reactive poses. Success means players notice and appreciate the hand details during combat.

### 2. **Character Expression System**
Establish hands as a primary method of non-verbal character expression. From exhaustion shown through drooping fingers to determination via white-knuckle grips, hands should convey the character's state without UI elements. Success means hands alone tell the story of the battle.

### 3. **Weapon Mastery Visualization**
Create a visual progression system where hand poses and grip styles evolve as players master weapons. Novice grips look tentative while master grips show confidence and control. Success means players can see their skill progression in their character's hands.

### 4. **Performance Benchmark Standard**
Maintain 60 FPS with full hand simulation on mid-range hardware. The hand system should be so optimized that adding it causes no noticeable performance impact. Success means the system scales to support 10+ characters simultaneously.

### 5. **Modular Animation Framework**
Build the hand system as a reusable framework that can be applied to any humanoid character in the game. NPCs, bosses, and multiplayer avatars should all benefit from the same hand technology. Success means dropping the system into any character "just works."

## Testing Methodology

Each phase includes specific test criteria to ensure:
1. **Functional Testing** - Does it work as intended?
2. **Performance Testing** - Does it maintain 60 FPS?
3. **Integration Testing** - Does it play nice with existing systems?
4. **Visual Testing** - Does it look good in motion?
5. **Edge Case Testing** - Does it handle unexpected inputs?

## Risk Mitigation

- **Version Control**: Commit after each successful phase
- **Rollback Plan**: Each phase can be reverted independently
- **Performance Budget**: Maximum 2ms per frame for hand systems
- **Fallback System**: Basic hand poses if advanced system fails
